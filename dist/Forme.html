HEADER FIRST SECTION

Header first section have the navbar and main text that is in the middle.
To keep the navbar vertically aligned padding and margin has been applied as follows:
 1. All 3 child elements of the "First Section" div has been given a margin top of "mt-30". 
 2. First child of "First Section" has been given padding of "p-10".
 3. Last child of "First Section" has been given padding top, right and bottom of "pt-10 pr-5 pb-10". Its padding left has been removed to keep it aligned with the icon.
 4. The second child has a padding of "p-6" but the padding left has been removed by a 'pl-0' to keep the main text aligned with the line. Hovever by doing this the logo gets out of align and it is fixed by adding a "pl-6" in the logo div.
